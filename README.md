# Royal Frame
Royal Frame is a unique new game you can play on your own.

It's challenging, fun and great to play on the go.

The game's objective is to fill the frame of the board with royal cards:
- Kings in the corners
- Queens in the middle-top and middle-bottom
- Jacks in the middle-left and middle-right



## How to play?
- Tap an empty spot to place the next card in it.
- Place royal cards in the designated spots.
- When the board is full, start removing pairs of cards that sum up to 10.
- If you filled the frame with royal cards - YOU WIN
- If your next card is royal and it's spots are already taken, you lose
- If there are no pairs that sum up to 10, you lose
